# Because Swap_push isn’t as natural
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted.

You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks.

Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.
